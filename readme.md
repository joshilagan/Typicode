- You type in something in the input box, click add, then it creates a todo card for you with the words you typed in the input box.
- Double click the todo card to delete it. Click a todo and it will turn gray, indicating that it is completed, click again to return it to its original color. 
- It sends the promises using DELETE, PUT, and POST methods. It utilizes the fetch() and .then() to handle the promises and responses. The new FormData() constructor was also utilized in this project to capture the input field.
